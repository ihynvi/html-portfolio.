    <h1>One Of My Favourite Horror Movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Medium</h3>
<p>
    It traumatised me. I watched it at 2 during winters when everyone as asleep. BEST JUMPSCARES EVER THEY WERE SO FRIGHTENING. my favourite horror movie but the ending was not satisfactory enough and it could have been better in my opinion. The best found footage movie. <br />
    9.5/10
</p>
<h3>2. Smile</h3>
<p>best jumpscares, it scared me so much which is why i liked it. i watched it at 1 so that might be the reason it felt scary. The seconnd time i watched it, I was a little less scared but it was worth watching atleast once.<br />
9/10
</p>
<h3>The Platform</h3>
<p> 
    It wasnt scary but it was traumatising. It was quite disgusting actually but the movie eventually kept getting better keeping the suspense of what the next level would be. Due to some disgusting scenes which involve faeces and eating a dog or human flesh, this movie wasnt the best i saw. tbh im putting it on number 3 because i cant remember any other movie.<br />
    6.5/10
